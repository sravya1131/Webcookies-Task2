Project Overview: ATM Java Program
Introduction
The ATM simulation program is designed to mimic basic banking operations such as checking account balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and transferring funds between accounts. The goal is to create a secure and user-friendly interface that prompts users for input and provides appropriate responses and error messages for invalid operations.

Features
Check Balance:

Users can check the balance of their accounts.
Provides a straightforward way to view current funds.
Deposit Money:

Users can deposit money into their accounts.
Ensures positive amounts and updates the balance accordingly.
Withdraw Money:

Users can withdraw money from their accounts.
Validates that the withdrawal amount is positive and does not exceed the available balance.
Transfer Funds:

Users can transfer funds between two accounts.
Ensures the transfer amount is positive and the source account has sufficient funds.
User-Friendly Interface:

The interface includes a menu-driven system with clear prompts and instructions.
Error messages are provided for invalid operations, ensuring smooth user experience.
Code Structure
Account Class:

Encapsulates account-related properties (account number and balance) and operations (deposit, withdraw, transfer).
Ensures that each account operates independently with its own state.
Main Class (ATM):

Contains the main method that drives the program.
Implements a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
Manages multiple accounts and provides options for various banking operations.
Scanner for User Input:

Uses Scanner for reading user inputs.
Ensures that inputs are handled efficiently and appropriately.
Control Flow:

A loop in the main method handles the display of the menu and execution of user-selected options.
Conditional statements check for valid operations and provide feedback.
Strengths
Modular Design:

The separation of account-related logic into its own class makes the code more readable and maintainable.
User-Friendly Interface:

Clear prompts and feedback messages enhance the user experience.
Robust Error Handling:

Provides appropriate error messages for invalid operations, such as insufficient funds or invalid amounts.
Secure Operations:

Ensures that only valid transactions are processed, maintaining the integrity of the account balances.
Potential Improvements
Input Validation:

Enhance input validation to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.
Add checks to ensure valid input ranges for deposit, withdrawal, and transfer amounts.
Multiple Accounts Management:

Extend the program to handle more than two accounts dynamically.
Implement a user login system to differentiate between multiple users.
Persistent Storage:

Add functionality to save account data to a file or database, allowing for persistent storage of account information across sessions.
Advanced Features:

Implement additional features such as transaction history, account creation, and account deletion.
Add support for different account types (savings, checking) with specific rules and interest calculations.
Enhanced User Experience:

Improve the user interface with more detailed instructions and confirmations for transactions.
Add a summary screen after each transaction to show the updated balance.
Conclusion
The ATM simulation program provides a solid foundation for basic banking operations, ensuring a secure and user-friendly interface. The use of a modular design and clear user prompts makes it easy to use and maintain. With additional features and improvements, it can become a more comprehensive and robust application suitable for more complex banking simulations. The current implementation demonstrates a good understanding of Java programming and object-oriented design principles.
